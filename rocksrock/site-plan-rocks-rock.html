      [Paragraph Title: Welcome Message] Welcome to Rocks Rock — where low-maintenance meets high companionship! College dorm life can be chaotic, stressful, and full of rules. One of the most heartbreaking? No pets allowed. But what if you could have a pet that doesn’t bark, bite, or shed… and never needs to be walked? That’s where our pet rocks come in.
      </p>
      <p>
      [Paragraph Title: Why Pet Rocks?]
Pet rocks are the ultimate dorm companions. They’re calm, quiet, and always there when you need a little emotional support. Feeling overwhelmed with finals? Your pet rock won’t judge your ramen noodle diet or your 3 a.m. breakdown. They’ll just sit patiently — like always — and be your solid friend. Literally.

      [Paragraph Title: Adoptable Rocks Preview]
Each of our pet rocks has a unique personality and story. Some are outdoorsy. Some are couch potatoes. Some have googly eyes. Whatever your vibe, there's a rock that’s ready to roll into your life. Here are just a few of our current adoptables:

      <p>
      [Paragraph Title: Sample Rock Bios]

      Pebbles – A shy but loyal friend. Loves quiet shelves and late-night study sessions.

      Granite George – Strong, silent type. May or may not be immortal. Big into mythology.

      Shelly – Painted with love and perfect for photo shoots. Has a big social media following.

      Chip – A little broken, a lot lovable. Ideal for students who love character and grit.

      Come visit the full lineup and see who speaks to your soul (silently, of course).

      <h3>Care & Companionship</h3>
      <p>
      [Paragraph Title: How to Care for Your Rock]
Luckily, caring for a pet rock is about as stress-free as it gets. No feeding schedules, vet visits, or potty training required. Still, we recommend a comfy resting spot (windowsills are popular), regular dusting, and occasional words of affirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
[Paragraph Title: Bonding Ideas]
Want to go above and beyond? Decorate a habitat with mini furniture or felt blankets. Give your rock a name and backstory. Take selfies together. Make them a profile on social media (yes, RockTok is real). These little gestures help build a meaningful, if very quiet, friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
[Paragraph Title: Benefits of Pet Rock Companionship]
Pet rocks are stress relievers, conversation starters, and reliable study buddies. They won’t interrupt your Zoom call, but they will be there when you need a mental break. In a world of distractions and noise, sometimes what we need most is a little stillness — and a good rock.
